## A Real Estate Portfolio Tracker
___
Vivaan's Real Estate Portfolio Tracker is an **intuitive and user-friendly application** that allows real estate agents to 
efficiently manage and keep track of their real estate properties and listings. This application will
serve as a convenient and effortless solution to complicated record-keeping, as it allows users to add new listings, keep track
of existing listings, sell listings and more.

Users can categorise the listings by demand, which helps determine trending listings and thus, provides valuable insights
to improve sales.

Growing up, I have always been interested in real estate and real estate management. As such, when I learnt that real estate agents
often manage a lot of listings at one time, I wanted to create an application that helps track the status of these listings
in the form of a real estate portfolio tracker.
