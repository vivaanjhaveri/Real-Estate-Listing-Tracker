Vivaan's Express Groceries is based out of Vancouver, but we offer low-cost delivery to every major Canadian city including Vancouver,
Victoria, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa, and Toronto.

As a student, I have firsthand experience with the troubles of grocery shopping namely the long lines, inflated prices, low quality, 
confusing aisles, and most importantly, the physical struggle of carrying multiple bags of groceries home. This led me to think that I can find
it inconvenient to have to go grocery shopping every two weeks, what about older people like our parents and grandparents, or people with disabilities? That is why I created Vivaan's Express 
Groceries, a *user-friendly and accessible alternative* to the time-consuming, tiring, expensive, and inconvenient ordeal of everyday grocery shopping.
